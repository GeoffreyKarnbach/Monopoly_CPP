# Monopoly_CPP


This is my first project using C++, as I will need it for an university class next term.

The idea is to make a complete monopoly simulation, that includes all basic Monopoly features.

The Monopoly Game is entirely customizable by modifying the "Fields.CSV" file.

Once the Monopoly Engine will be done, the goal is to experiment with different playing "Paradigms" as for example:

- ALWAYS BUY
- ALWAYS BUILD (CHEAPEST / MOST EXPENSIVE / MIX)
- WAIT IN JAIL

Once all the "paradigms" have been determined, the player instances will adopt some behaviours and do a sort of "tournament" to determine which strategy works best in Monopoly, by keeping the best configuration of each round (each round consisting on thousands of matches). The winners will be "merged" together to combine some of their attributes (similar to evolutionary algorithms).
